Blockland places bricks based on midpoints, so the following math is important:
- x: x - (len / 2)
- y: y + (len / 2)

When placing two bricks adjacent to each other, the following formulas are needed:
- for x, y, let current = {
	  x - len = 0 => x - (len / 2),
	  x - len > 0 => (current + last) / 2
          }
- let last = current
